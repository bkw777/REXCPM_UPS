# REXCPM UPS
A replacement Model 100 system bus board for REXCPM  

## goals  
* battery to keep the REXCPM sram powered while out of the 100 or when the 100's batteries die  
* simpler more convenient standard round pins, simpler to repair  
* more robust all 40 pins instead of delicate single unsupported pins without neighbors  
* more pins -> more friction -> more secure installation  
  also the pins are fatter, which is ok in this case because the socket has round sockets not flat leaf type  
* parts on bottom in the space created by the tall shoulders of the standard pins  
* lower profile so that the board no longer pushes up on the compartment cover (the main REXCPM module needs this too but will not be so easy)  
* nicer look, board outline with pin-1 notch matching the socket
