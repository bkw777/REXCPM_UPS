This one is not ideal because the wire has a bulky and stiff jacket, but it's more likely to be in stock somewhere.

This one is not ideal only because it's much longer than necessary, but it's available, and the excess can be spooled up inside the option rom compartment.

If REXCPM has the qwiic connector mod, then you need specifically the "A" / "reversed" version of this cable, which is out of stock. "reversed is a mis-nomer for this unfortunately. The pinout is actually pointedly NOT reversed, which is why you must use this one. Pin 1 on one end goes to pin 1 on the other end.

If the REXCPM does not have the qwiic connector mod and you are going to cut the connector off of one end and make some other kind of connection, then it's ok to get the "B" version of the cable.
The connector is actually a tiny IDC type, so you may possibly be able to peel out the wires and re-install them in reversed order, or just cut & splice the wires in the middle. This cable is labelled / described as not reversed, but actually it is reversed. Pin 1 on one end goes to pin 4 on the other end. You can not use this cable as it is. You must cut and re-arrange the wires somehow, somewhere, to make it so that pin 1 on one end goes to GND on the REXCPM, 2 -> /WR, 3 -> RAM, and pin 4 goes to RAMRST on the REXCPM.
